# Robust Frame-to-Frame Camera Rotation Estimation in Crowded Scenes

非常 robust 的直接从 optical flow 中计算 camera rotation 的方法。

基本假设

> we assume that camera translations between frames are small relative to distant points in the scene. This ensures that the flows of distant scene points are well-modeled by rotations. Thus, our method is designed to work in outdoor scenes (or spacious indoor scenes, like arenas) where the translational camera motions are small relative to
the most distant objects
